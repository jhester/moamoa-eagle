Ka Moamoa Lab EAGLE Part Libraries
===================
This repository contains a bunch of EAGLE parts used in lab harware projects. All parts have been tested and used in real hardware.

#### Usage
Include this repository in your EAGLE libraries search path.

#### Adding Parts
Make sure you document the part in the library (Description, part number, etc, copy / paste from datasheet), and update the README, including the part and a short description.

#### Notes:
Generally, each library holds one part (and is named by that part), because often packages can differ slightly even if they are the "same," this also allows for repository control, as libraries are binary, so a change in one part in a large library requires the entire library to be re-synced, this makes it difficult to track changes.

**EDIT: The above is NOT TRUE anymore**

#### TODO
- Autogenerate the parts list, and description from the library files.
- Merge to a single library, or set of libraries, cleanup, and add digikey part numbers and descriptions to all parts.
